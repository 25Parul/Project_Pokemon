## Game Map 🗺️

The game map was created using the Tiled Map Editor, which allows you to create your own map using the tileset images provided in the `images` folder. The `pokemon_Town.png` file in the `images` folder contains the map used in the game.

Download the Tiled Map Editor [https://www.mapeditor.org/](https://www.mapeditor.org/).

## Usage 🎮

When the game starts, you will see the player character on the map. You can move the player character around the map using the arrow keys on your keyboard. If you walk on the dark green grass patches, a battle sequence will be triggered.

In the battle sequence, you can select from two different attacks: Tackle and Fireball which can be selected by clicking on the corresponding buttons. The attack types are randomized for your enemy in the battle. The first Pokemon to run out of its health loses the battle.
